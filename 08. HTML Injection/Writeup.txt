[Part 1: Before we start]

    - This time I gonna tell you a little bit about JavaScript web APIs

        (The hierarchy below is created by CBJS, I just re-draw it in ASCII)

        [?] "APIs" _ "Application Programming Interfaces" are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

        [?] "window" is where everything begins, it is the first thing created when the browser opens a website

                [Example]: window.InnerHeight <=> 0
                        
                           window.InnerWidth <=> 0

        [?] "navigator" contains information about the user's browser    

                [Example]: window.navigator.userAgent <=> Mozilla/5.0 (X11, Linux x86_64, rv:109.0) Gecko/20109101 Firefox/114.0
                        
                           window.navigator.language <=> en-US

        [?] "history" allows us to interact with the browser's history

                [Example]: window.history.lenght <=> 177013 (~.~!)
                        
                           window.history.back() <=> return to the previous web

        [?] "location" stores info about the URL of the website you are using. Also, it can help you redirect to the other websites

                [Example]: window.location.href <=> https://www.hungthinhtran.com
                        
                           window.location.protocol  <=> https

        [?] "DOM Methods" contains many functions like getElementById(), getElementByTagName(), getElementByClassName() ...
                           all of them were born to help developers interact with DOM tree 

    - A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, there was a man called Tim Berners-Lee, he is the father of WWW (World Wide Web) and HTML (Yeah! he's still alive)

    - Since HTML is just like a blue-print for the website and there is no user interaction, developers want something that can make their website more lively

        => That is the reason why JavaScript was born

    - But each browser used JavaScript in its own way, which led to a consequence that your browser may not show websites that were created for another specific browser

        => And W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the one who united them all by publicized the DOM tree (Document Object Model) => The problem was solved

    - So! Before deep dive into the battlefield of injection, you should know about SOP (Same-Origin Policy)

        [+] This is a fundamental security mechanism in the World Wide Web that restricts how a web browser interacts with resources from different origins.

            => Prevent malicious scripts from accessing sensitive data from other websites without the user's consent

        [+] The SOP enforces the concept of origin, which is typically defined as a combination of the scheme (like HTTP or HTTPS), hostname, and port number of a URL.

        [+] A web page loaded from one origin cannot make requests to resources from a different origin unless explicitly allowed.
